The intent of this embark profile is to provide a balance between micro and
macromanagement on embark.  While the player is given the raw stones for coke
and bronze (alloy of copper + tin), they are also provided with a surplus of
food, tools, and leveled skills so that the dwarves can still easily get to
safety (for example, reanimating evil biomes).  Dwarves have skills pre-set
for having a manager, bookkeeper, broker, and chief medical dwarf.

Because of the need for this embark to have reasonable levels of metal ores
and bituminous coal, every wood object on a "Play Now!" embark has been
sacrificed.  If you need buckets, crutches, splints, a wheelbarrow, or a
stepladder, you will have to make those on your own.

    [TITLE:clinodev's Annotated Craftlords (Open embark_profiles.txt or pastebin.com/2xNtgiqS for tutorial!)]

Hello, folks!

I thought it might be fun and educational to annotate my Craftlords embark
profile with the logic behind, as a sort of combined tutorial on playing the
profile, and on making your own profiles. Conveniently, the game ignores any
text that isn't in square brackets! You can actually copy this entire post to
the bottom of your current embark_profiles.txt! You might be reading this
there right now if you're playing Dwarf Fortress v47 or later!

Not every "best practice" in an embark profile can be used in a widely
distributed pack, and I've pointed out a few things that can be improved
situationally. I'm interested in your feedback!

Craftlords are aspiring master smiths, craftsdwarves, and artists. They've
set out searching for a home where they can focus on the art of transforming
the raw stuff of the mountain into the finest examples of Craftdwarfsmanship
to be found anywhere in the world, (and get what they deserve in trade!)
They've also made sure they know the basics of defending themselves, and how
to bind their wounds. They will quickly teach each other their skills if you
put them in a military squad!

As always, each has at least one good, dwarfy, moodable skill as its main,
and they are as fully skilled as possible. I have avoided assigning skills
that are easily trained (mining, woodcutting) produce "no quality" goods
(wood burning, strand extracting, furnace operating) or ephemeral/peasant
goods (brewing, cooking, cheesemaking, wood crafting.) Skills that I find
"insufficiently dwarfy" are also excluded. My starting seven are meant to
end up famous craftsmen in comfortable craft halls, and while they will
perform some many tasks early on, once lesser dwarves have arrived, they'll
be allowed to focus on their Arts. Migrants who arrive as Master Craftsdwarves
(after a careful check for vampirism,) and the rare apprentice who shows rare
talent (through a mood, usually,) are similarly honored.

The Engraver

This dwarf's dream is to carve the fortress into a palace of art and learning,
engraved with the legends and histories of their people. In addition, they've
learned to master their fears, and to teach a bit about the proper use of armor.

    [SKILL:1:KNOWLEDGE_ACQUISITION:1]


The Armorer

Well on their way to becoming a master armorsmith, they've always been
concerned about protecting their fellow dwarves. When they weren't
learning at the forge, they were studying basic medicine.

The Weaponsmith

More skilled than most at forging arms, this dwarf has also taken lessons
with spear and shield, and is prepared to teach others all they know.

The Jeweler

Almost equally skilled at setting gems, making goblets, minting coins,
and making wonderous metal toys and crafts, they can also build metal
constructions, and even forge anvils! This dwarf will quickly fill the
fortress and trade depot with fine goods!

    [SKILL:4:FORGE_FURNITURE:1]

(Why no gem cutting? Cutting small gems is a "no quality" skill. Any no-skill
peasant can cut them as well as a master, if not as quickly. The Jeweler will
pick the skill up quickly enough if you enable it that the 5% of cutting jobs
that are large gems or gem crafts will be masterwork soon enough! I often
just enable it on large numbers of dwarves with no other moodable skills.)

The Glassmaker

Trained to transform the unlimited sand of the surface layers into virtually
any good made by  other craftsdwarves, the Glassmaker often replaces them in
mature fortresses. In the process of learning to make such a grand array of
goods, our glassmaker has learned to judge the value of things, and the
intentions of buyers and sellers, making them an excellent trade broker.
They very often end up being the expedition leader as well.

The Engineer

Meticulously trained in the engineering arts, this dwarf is in their element
designing feindish traps from simple stonefalls to elaborate "reception rooms"
that fill with pressurized magma at the pull of a lever. They can build the
most meticulous mechanisms and machine components with their own hands. They
understand the smelting of every metal and alloy known to dwarvenkind, and can
even be found discussing the intricacies of fluid mechanics with visiting
scholars.

The Mason

In love with the very bones of the earth, this dwarf is experienced with
making nearly any stone object, from granite puzzleboxes to marble bridges,
basalt furnaces to obsidian short swords. Their experience with designing
larger constructions has given them an installing them has given them an
insight into architecture.

    [SKILL:7:STONECRAFT:4]
    [SKILL:7:DESIGNBUILDING:1]

Common concerns about the starting skills:

"Wait, where are your miners?"

Once upon a time, mining skill determined how many precious ore stones
dropped from mining, but now there is a straight 25%/33%/100% chance for
level stone, vein stone, and small cluster stone, respectively. Highly
skilled miners are much faster, of course, but as you'll see below, my
Starting Seven will quickly have six picks between them, which makes early
mining go pretty darn fast! In practice, mining skill goes up so fast, the
least busy starters on any given embark often end up training mining as
their highest skill accidentally anyway before I can turn it off in favor
of migrants. Dwarf Fortress streamers I've enticed to try this profile pack
have often been surprised to discover they're a season or more ahead of
their normal digging schedule the first year.

"Wait, where is your woodcutter?"

Admittedly, untrained woodcutters are sometimes a menace to themselves and
others these days, but the embark profile starts with enough wood for a
decent early dormitory. Most other wooden things are better done with stone,
metal, or glass, and removing the small number of trees blocking early
constructions is a reasonable risk. Woodcutting as a profession also implies
that being outside is a good thing! It's best left to migrants, or practiced
in the caverns. There is an axe included in case it's needed right away,
and many more can be made if needed.

"Wait, where are your cooks, growers, herbalists, and brewers?"

Well, those are all fine things, of course, and can be assigned temporarily
to the Starting Seven, and then permanently to early migrants, but high skill
is hardly required in the early days of the fortress. The embark equipment
below probably includes nearly enough food and drink to make it through to the
first Dwarven caravan, even if you forget to grow crops or build nest boxes
(assuming average migration waves.) Brewing up the plump helmets is a pretty
important task, though, a great task for a first Summer migrant!

"Wait, where are your cheesemakers and fisherdwarves?"

Okay, you're just trolling now. On to starting equipment.

Starting Equipment

Tools and Crafting Materials

[ITEM:1:ANVIL:NONE:INORGANIC:IRON]

An anvil is absolutely critical to this build. Don't leave the Mountainhome without it!

[ITEM:1:WEAPON:ITEM_WEAPON_AXE_BATTLE:INORGANIC:COPPER]

A starting axe is a bit dubious for this build, to be honest. It was added
some time back when wooden training axes stopped working for cutting down
trees, and because I grew tired of explaining why there was no axe.
I personally always delete it for the points.

"Whoa, wait, you promised me 6 picks, I don't see them, and what do you mean,
you delete the axe for the points? What about weapons and armor?
There's nothing there!"

Calm down, Urist, everything is going to be fine. See, we're Craftlords,
and if we're going to devote our lives to turning the riches of the mountain
into fine goods, what better time to start than right away? Unless we are in
immediate danger upon embarking, the first thing we want to do is assign our
mason to Furnace Operating and Architecture, and build a smelter, which we set
to "Make coke from bituminous coal" three times, which will give us plenty of
coke fuel for now. Then we "Make bronze bars (use ore)" three times, which will
give us enough bronze for 24(!) axes, picks, etc., or a lesser number of other
weapons and armor. The ore included will produce a total of 80 bronze bars,
and 161 coke fuel, but it's easier to move the ores than bars, so three of
each job is plenty.

While this is going on, build a Metalsmith's Forge, and go ahead and start
making picks, axes, and spears as required. I make six picks, one spear,
and an axe to start.

[ITEM:1:BAR:NONE:COAL:COKE]

It takes fuel to make coke fuel! Without this starting bar, I'd need to build
a Wood Furnace to make charcoal fuel before I could start producing coke fuel.
Pure laziness, but it's much easier.

[ITEM:1:BAR:NONE:INORGANIC:COPPER]

This copper bar is an emergency backup, in case things are scarier on embark
than planned. I can throw up a Metalsmith's Forge and make a quick pick to
dig in the wagon (using the included coke fuel,) and worry about the other
tools later.

[ITEM:20:BOULDER:NONE:INORGANIC:COAL_BITUMINOUS]

While 161 coke fuel seems like a lot, it goes pretty quick when you're using
it for all your metal and glass needs. It's fairly cheap, and you can use it
to build a quick wall in an emergency if needed. Occasionally, bituminous coal
is not available to your civilization, and can be replaced by more expensive
(per unit of fuel,) lignite or wood. Wood has to be burned at a wood furnace
into charcoal to be used as fuel.

[ITEM:10:BOULDER:NONE:INORGANIC:BAUXITE]

The traditional fire/magma proof red stone, for those first few temporary
workshops. It can be used (along with the wood and coal,) in a pinch for an
emergency early surface bunker over the wagon. While bauxite is usually
available, this is a common failure point like bituminous coal. It can be
replaced with olivine, petrified wood, orthoclase, rutile, or other cheap
magma-safe stone.

[ITEM:10:BOULDER:NONE:INORGANIC:CASSITERITE]

[ITEM:10:BOULDER:NONE:INORGANIC:MALACHITE]

These are the cheapest ores commonly available for bronze. The malachite can be
replaced with copper nuggets for the same price, or tetrahedrite for a little
more. There's an argument for bismuth bronze, but in a distributed profile,
it's just one more potential failure point
(it's also not a great argument, to be honest.)

[ITEM:50:POWDER_MISC:NONE:INORGANIC:SAND_TAN]

Glass is love, glass is life! Cheap bags are handy! Seriously, though, glass
is awesome. I never embark on any site with no sand now, and my main need for
bags remains sand. If you need a handful of points to buy something else, this
is a place to get them.

[ITEM:10:WOOD:NONE:PLANT_MAT:TOWER_CAP:WOOD]

Starting beds from properly dwarfy subterranean mushroom wood, such luxury!
Mushroom woods are nearly always available, but if your civilization is missing
Tower Cap, replace it with some other wood.


Drink, Food, and Livestock

[ITEM:40:PLANT:NONE:PLANT_MAT:MUSHROOM_HELMET_PLUMP:STRUCTURAL]
[ITEM:28:DRINK:NONE:PLANT_MAT:GRASS_TAIL_PIG:DRINK]
[ITEM:28:DRINK:NONE:PLANT_MAT:POD_SWEET:DRINK]
[ITEM:28:DRINK:NONE:PLANT_MAT:GRASS_WHEAT_CAVE:DRINK]
[PET:8:BIRD_GUINEAFOWL:FEMALE:STANDARD]
[PET:2:BIRD_GUINEAFOWL:MALE:STANDARD]

"Wait, I was promised tons of food and drink, even if I forgot to build nest
boxes or plant crops! That's not tons!"

Well, do try to remember, and also make sure cooking is turned off for plump
helmets. Once you've eaten or brewed all the plump helmets up, you'll probably
be okay (with average first migration waves,) until the first caravan for
booze (and much more secure if you plant something, or gather plants on the
surface or in the caverns.) You could replace those with brewable garden
vegetables for even more booze, but it's hard to predict which ones will be
available for an embark, while plumpies are always there. Replace them if
you prefer!

Now, as for food, I prefer guineafowl for eggs because they have decent
clutch size, mature quickly, and don't leave a lot of parts behind when they
die. They are terrible for meat, though, so don't bother butchering them.

"You said no nest boxes!"

Alright, actually do build those nest boxes and plots, but butcher your draft
animals (the ones you get free for drawing your wagon,) which will get you at
least another 60 food, and sometimes double that. If you luck out with females,
milk them first and make cheese!

Seeds

[ITEM:14:SEEDS:NONE:PLANT_MAT:MUSHROOM_HELMET_PLUMP:SEED]
[ITEM:14:SEEDS:NONE:PLANT_MAT:GRASS_TAIL_PIG:SEED]
[ITEM:7:SEEDS:NONE:PLANT_MAT:GRASS_WHEAT_CAVE:SEED]
[ITEM:7:SEEDS:NONE:PLANT_MAT:POD_SWEET:SEED]
[ITEM:14:SEEDS:NONE:PLANT_MAT:BUSH_QUARRY:SEED]
[ITEM:7:SEEDS:NONE:PLANT_MAT:MUSHROOM_CUP_DIMPLE:SEED]

Why multiples of seven seeds? I use 1x7 plots early on, because it's the
smallest efficient plot to fertilize. If you're worried about plump helmet
seeds, just hold off on the Spring crop until the plumpies have been brewed
up. There's a common tendency to grow far more underground field crops than
a fortress needs, by the way. It's much more efficient to under-grow and
make it up with exotic caravan food than over-grow to the point where you're
selling food just to keep it from rotting.

Moodables

[ITEM:1:THREAD:NONE:CREATURE_MAT:SPIDER_CAVE:SILK]
[ITEM:1:CLOTH:NONE:CREATURE_MAT:SPIDER_CAVE:SILK]
[ITEM:1:CHAIN:NONE:CREATURE_MAT:SPIDER_CAVE:SILK]

They're not that expensive, and they've saved me on freak early moods before
I have any textiles set up.

Pets

[PET:4:DOG:FEMALE:STANDARD]
[PET:2:DOG:MALE:STANDARD]

Dogs are useful for spotting sneakers and training up for war and hunting.

[PET:1:CAT:MALE:STANDARD]

As is tradition. Cats aren't actually all that useful, honestly, and they
clutter the place with vermin corpses. But, tradition. I may or may not put
the points into something else.

Enjoy! --clinodev
